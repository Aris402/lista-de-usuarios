## React Project

1 - I made this project during my fourth year at IFRN

2 - It consists of consuming users from the API and creating a list with them, being able to see their posts and tasks to be completed, which also come from the API.

3 - It was developed using React, Vite.js and Typescript



Here's a image from the project's login screen, but there's no authentication

Below, a image of the users list

If we click on the first icon, the application shows the posts from that user

And if we click on the second icon, the application shows the user's tasks

Finally, in the application there's a navigation bar too
